# Set up Snyk Broker with Azure Repos

Follow the instructions on this page to set up Snyk Azure Repos with Snyk Broker. This integration is useful to ensure a secure connection with your on-premise or cloud Azure Repos deployment.

## Configure Broker to be used with Azure Repos

{% hint style="info" %}
Ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

You need Docker or a way to run Docker ***LINUX*** containers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Snyk supports only Azure DevOps/TFS 2020 or above.

The following explains how to configure Snyk Broker to be used with Azure Repos.

To use the Broker Client with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), **run** `docker pull snyk/broker:azure-repos` tag. The following environment variables are required to configure the Broker client:

* `BROKER_TOKEN` - the Snyk Broker token, obtained from your Azure Repos integration settings view (app.snyk.io).
* `AZURE_REPOS_TOKEN` - an Azure Repos personal access token. Refer to this [Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops\&tabs=preview-page) for how to get or create the token. Required scopes: ensure Custom defined is selected and under Code select _Read & write._
* `AZURE_REPOS_ORG` - organization name, which can be found in your Organization Overview page in Azure. For Azure Repos on-prem, the typical organization name is `tfs/Main`
* `AZURE_REPOS_HOST` - the hostname of your Azure Repos Server deployment, such as `your.azure-server.domain.com`.
* `PORT` - the local port at which the Broker client accepts connections. Default is 8000.
* `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` - the full URL of the Broker client as it will be accessible to your Azure Repos' webhooks, such as `http://broker.url.example:8000.`This URL is required to access features such as PR Fixes or PR Checks.
* `ACCEPT_IAC` - by default, some file types used by Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) are not enabled. To grant the Broker access to IaC files in your repository, for example, Terraform, you can add an environment variable, `ACCEPT_IAC`, with any combination of `tf,yaml,yml,json,tpl`
* `ACCEPT_CODE` - by default, when using the Snyk Broker - Code Agent, Snyk Code will not load code snippets. To enable code snippets you can add an environment variable, `ACCEPT_CODE=true`

**Use the following command** to set up a fully configured Broker Client to analyze Open Source, IaC, Container, and Code files (with the Code Agent).

```bash
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=<secret-broker-token> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_TOKEN=<secret-azure-token> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_ORG=<org-name> \
           -e AZURE_REPOS_HOST=<your.azure-server.domain.com (no http/s)> \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=<http://broker.url.example:8000 (dns/IP:port)> \
           -e ACCEPT_IAC=tf,yaml,yml,json,tpl \
           -e ACCEPT_CODE=true \
       snyk/broker:azure-repos
```

**If necessary,** go to the Advanced Configuration section of [Install and configure the Snyk Broker client](../set-up-snyk-broker/how-to-install-and-configure-your-snyk-broker-client.md) and **make any configuration changes** needed, such as providing the CA (Certificate Authority) to the Broker Client configuration if the Azure Repos instance is using a private certificate, and setting up [proxy support](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-broker/set-up-snyk-broker/how-to-install-and-configure-your-snyk-broker-client#proxy-support).

As an alternative to using the Docker run command, you can use a derived Docker image to set up the Broker Client integration. See [Derived Docker images](../../../snyk-admin/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-set-up-examples/derived-docker-images-for-broker-client-integrations-and-container-registry-agent.md) for the environment variables to override for the Azure Repos integration.

### Custom allowlist through ACCEPT parameter

In addition, a fully configured `accept.json` for Snyk IaC, Code, Open Source and Container for Azure Repos is attached to use if you want to configure a custom allowlist. You cannot run the `ACCEPT_IAC` and `ACCEPT_CODE` arguments at the same time as the `ACCEPT` argument:

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/accept (1) (1) (1) (3) (2).json" %}

### Start the Broker Client container

Paste the Broker Client configuration to start the Broker Client container.

Once the container is up, the Azure Repos Integrations page shows the connection to Azure Repos and you can `Add Projects.`

## Basic troubleshooting for Broker with Azure Repos

* Run `docker logs <container id>` to look for any errors, where `container id` is the Azure Repos Broker container ID.
* Ensure relevant ports are exposed to Azure Repos.
* Make sure that file permissions for the local path to as well as the `accept.json` file itself are correct and accessible.
